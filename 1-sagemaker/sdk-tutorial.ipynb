    "Amazon SageMaker AI is an umbrella of services that AWS provides for Machine Learning (ML). In a nutshell, it is a service that enables the developer to be much more efficient with their valuable time when developing and deploying ML models. This methodology is applicable across many learning algorithms and many production use cases.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will harness some of the most commonly used microservices of SageMaker AI to contruct basic components of a machine learning workflow. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "* Launch a processing job to preprocess your data.\n",
    "* Launch a training job and build your ML model.\n",
    "* Deploy an endpoint to serve as an API for your trained model.\n",
    "* Launch a batch transform job to try out your trained model.\n",
