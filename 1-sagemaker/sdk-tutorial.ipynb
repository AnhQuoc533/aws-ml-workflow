    "Amazon SageMaker AI is an umbrella of services that AWS provides for Machine Learning (ML). In a nutshell, it is a service that enables the developer to be much more efficient with their valuable time when developing and deploying ML models. This methodology is applicable across many learning algorithms and many production use cases.\n",

Therefore, in order for this algorithm to work, you have to format the input data correctly. This is true for any other algorithm or model you work with, as each of them requires a particular type and structure of the input data.

Then, cut the text into individual sentences, while ensuring that each sentence retains the original label from the review. When splitting using the character `.`, make sure that no empty sentences are created, since reviews usually contain an ellipsis `...` or more. Your input data should look something like this:\n",

Since this tutorial only focuses on using microservices of SageMaker AI, it does not go over any tips on how to improve your model. For that, you may need to train a new model with fine-tuned [hyperparameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/blazingtext_hyperparameters.html#blazingtext_hyperparameters_text_class) or with a different algorithm. Finally, always read the documentation of the algorithm you are working with to minimize error and understand its hyperparameters.
